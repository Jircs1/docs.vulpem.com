Nigiri provides a command line interface that manages a selection of `docker-compose` batteries included to have ready-to-use bitcoin `regtest` development environment, with a **bitcoin** node, **electrum** explorer both backend and frontend user interface. 

It offers a [JSON HTTP proxy passtrough, called Nigiri Chopsticks](https://github.com/vulpemventures/nigiri-chopsticks) that adds to the explorer handy endpoints like `/faucet` and `/mint` with automatic block generation.

You can have Elements too with the `--liquid` flag.
